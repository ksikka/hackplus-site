<p class="tagline">Six weeks of hacking, learning, and growing together.
<br>Culminates in a demo day/celebration.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
To push the boundaries of what we can do with computing technology.
<br>To share our diverse knowledge and skills with each other.
<br>To grow as individuals and as a community.
</p>

<h2>What do we do</h2>
<p>
Each Saturday,
<br>We do a 20 minute standup on projects' progress.
<br>Then a student gives a tech talk on a topic of interest.
<br>Then we break up into our project groups and work on our hacks for a few hours.
<br>We celebrate our progress in an epic demo day, and publish our stories on a blog.
</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul class="project-list">
  <li>
    <h3>Augmented Reality DJ Controller</h3>
    <p>Turns a piece of paper into a DJ controller.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Android MyoWire</h3>
    <p>Wires you in faster by turning your hand into a music playlist controller.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Internet of CoffeeMachines</h3>
    <p>Interact with your coffee maker through an online API.</p>
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>Need an Arduino? Leap Motion? Raspberry Pi(es)? No problem. ACM is providing any hardware/software resources that teams want to develop with/for within reason. You tell us what you need, we'll provide it for you.</p>

<h2>How to Get Involved</h2>
<p>We're looking for fellow students to join us as we build things. If you have a project you're working on, or want to join on of these projects, please contact us. You don't have to know much (we're all learning here) but you do have to commit about 4 hours a week.</p>
